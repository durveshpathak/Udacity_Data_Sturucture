Time Complexity analysis:

Task 0:

Only printing records of call these are constant time operations
Time Complexity is constant O(1)

Task 1:

since we will search only first two column for number the complexity for searching numbers in both the files will be
Time Complexity is Linear O(2n+2n) ~ O(n)

Task 2:
since we will search only first two column for number 
Time Complexity is Linear O(2n + constants) ~ O(n)

Task 3:

Time Complexity is Linear for all the task O(n), the while in findACandMN() will run for at most 5 times so the so the
complexity would be O(5n) ~ O(n)

Task 4:
n rows in calls.csv; m rows in text.csv; q list of unique numbers
Time Complexity is Quadratic O(qn)+O(2qm)**worst case if all the numbers are unique O(n^2)
