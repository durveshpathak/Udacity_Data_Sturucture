Time Complexity analysis:

Task 0:

Time Complexity is constant O(1)

Task 1:

Time Complexity is Quadratic O(n^2)

Task 2:

Time Complexity is Quadratic O(n^2)

Task 3:

Time Complexity is Linear for all the task O(n), the while in findACandMN() will run for at most 5 times so the so the
complexity would be O(5n) ~ O(n)

Task 4:

Time Complexity is Linear O(n)
